== !! JS console error note !! ==
When navigating to the 404 section in the customizer, there is an intentional JS error:
"Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)"

This occurs because the customizer previewer is loading a non-existent page so the 404 page
can be previewed while be customized!
